# ATM_MACHINE_OPERATION_USING_PYTHON

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a simple **ATM Machine Simulation** developed using **Python**.  
It allows a user to perform basic ATM operations through a menu-driven program.

The user can:
- Check account balance  
- Deposit money  
- Withdraw money  
- Exit the program  

The account balance updates dynamically after each transaction.

## 🛠️ Features
- Menu-driven interface
- Balance inquiry
- Deposit functionality
- Withdrawal with insufficient balance check
- Continuous operation until user exits

---

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**

---

## ▶️ How the Program Works
1. The program starts with an initial balance of **Rs. 5000**
2. A menu is displayed repeatedly using a `while` loop
3. The user selects an option by entering a number (1–4)
4. Based on the choice, the corresponding operation is performed
5. The program exits only when the user selects option **4**
